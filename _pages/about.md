Hello! I'm Adon Rosen, a psychometrician and quantitative psychologist dedicated to advancing the precise measurement of psychological phenomena.

Presently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/), where I conduct research under the esteemed mentorship of [Dr. Ashley Watts](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/psychological_sciences/bio/ashley-watts). My work centers on developing and optimizing measurement models for the assessment of psychopathology, aiming to enhance the accuracy and utility of diagnostic and evaluative tools.

I earned my PhD in [Quantitative Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_psychology) from the [University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu/). My research agenda is primarily focused on the intersection of psychopathology assessment and measurement with intensive longitudinal modeling. This includes a broad interest in understanding dynamic psychological processes over time. My applied interests further extend to exploring brain-behavior relationships, developing sophisticated methods for measuring adversity and neglect, and analyzing dyadic interactions.

Prior to my time at OU I was a senior data analyst at the University of Pennsylvania. At Penn I was mentored by Ruben C. Gur and Tyler Moore, where I worked on examining brain-behavior relationships in a neruodevelopmental cohort. 

Outside of my research, I can be found [enjoying both mountain biking and road cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/15237851). I'm also an amateur chef who loves culinary exploration and a devoted [reader of science fiction and fantasy literature](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/127660078-adon-rosen), with a growing interest in historical nonfiction.
