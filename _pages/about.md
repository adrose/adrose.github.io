Hello! I'm Adon Rosen, a psychometrician and quantitative psychologist. My research agenda is primarily focused on the intersection of psychopathology assessment and measurement with intensive longitudinal modeling. This includes a broad interest in understanding dynamic psychological processes over time. My applied interests further extend to exploring brain-behavior relationships, developing sophisticated methods for measuring adversity and neglect, and analyzing dyadic interactions.

Presently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/), where I conduct research under the mentorship of [Dr. Ashley Watts](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/psychological_sciences/bio/ashley-watts). My work centers on developing and optimizing measurement models for the assessment of psychopathology, aiming to enhance the accuracy and utility of diagnostic and evaluative tools.

I earned my PhD in [Quantitative Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_psychology) from the [University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu/). I worked with [Hairong Song](https://www.ou.edu/cas/psychology/people/faculty/hairong-song) and [David Bard](https://medicine.ouhsc.edu/academic-departments/pediatrics/sections/developmental-behavioral-pediatrics/faculty/david-bard-phd) where I developed techniques to analyze time series of verbaliziations from parent-child dyads. [Here](https://shareok.org/items/1e468910-4b6c-46ff-8d5a-a50df63d66c8) is my dissertation which applies multilevel markov models parameterzied through a surivial modeling framework, and [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=8tLT5KYAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=8tLT5KYAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC) is a recent publication of these same data.

Prior to my time at OU I was a senior data analyst at the University of Pennsylvania. At Penn I was mentored by [Ruben C. Gur](https://www.med.upenn.edu/bbl/faculty-rcgur.html) and [Tyler Moore](https://www.med.upenn.edu/bbl/staff-mmoore.html), where I worked on examining brain-behavior relationships in a neurodevelopmental cohort. [Here](https://journals.aai.org/cercor/article/31/3/1444/5942923) is an example of these analyses that examined brain-behavior relaitonships from multimodal neuroimaging data predicting cognitive performance on the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery.

Outside of my research, I can be found [enjoying both mountain biking and road cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/15237851), reading [science fiction or fantasy literature](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/127660078-adon-rosen), with a growing interest in historical nonfiction.
