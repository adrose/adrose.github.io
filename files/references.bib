  abstract = {Multiple studies have shown that data quality is a critical confound in the construction of brain networks derived from functional MRI. This problem is particularly relevant for studies of human brain development where important variables (such as participant age) are correlated with data quality. Nevertheless, the impact of head motion on estimates of structural connectivity derived from diffusion tractography methods remains poorly characterized. Here, we evaluated the impact of in-scanner head motion on structural connectivity using a sample of 949 participants (ages 8-23 years old) who passed a rigorous quality assessment protocol for diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) acquired as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Structural brain networks were constructed for each participant using both deterministic and probabilistic tractography. We hypothesized that subtle variation in head motion would systematically bias estimates of structural connectivity and confound developmental inference, as observed in previous studies of functional connectivity. Even following quality assurance and retrospective correction for head motion, eddy currents, and field distortions, in-scanner head motion significantly impacted the strength of structural connectivity in a consistency- and length-dependent manner. Specifically, increased head motion was associated with reduced estimates of structural connectivity for network edges with high inter-subject consistency, which included both short- and long-range connections. In contrast, motion inflated estimates of structural connectivity for low-consistency network edges that were primarily shorter-range. Finally, we demonstrate that age-related differences in head motion can both inflate and obscure developmental inferences on structural connectivity. Taken together, these data delineate the systematic impact of head motion on structural connectivity, and provide a critical context for identifying motion-related confounds in studies of structural brain network development.},

  abstract = {Participant motion during functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) acquisition produces spurious signal fluctuations that can confound measures of functional connectivity. Without mitigation, motion artifact can bias statistical inferences about relationships between connectivity and individual differences. To counteract motion artifact, this protocol describes the implementation of a validated, high-performance denoising strategy that combines a set of model features, including physiological signals, motion estimates, and mathematical expansions, to target both widespread and focal effects of subject movement. This protocol can be used to reduce motion-related variance to near zero in studies of functional connectivity, providing up to a 100-fold improvement over minimal-processing approaches in large datasets. Image denoising requires 40 min to 4 h of computing per image, depending on model specifications and data dimensionality. The protocol additionally includes instructions for assessing the performance of a denoising strategy. Associated software implements all denoising and diagnostic procedures, using a combination of established image-processing libraries and the eXtensible Connectivity Pipeline (XCP) software.},

  abstract = {Objective Suicide has been a leading cause death in adolescents nationally for years; the full effect of COVID-19 pandemic and social isolation on pediatric mental health and subsequent suicidality is not yet fully understood. Method This retrospective chart review describes trends in patients aged 4-17 years of age who presented to the emergency room or for hospital admission with suicidal thoughts or acts of self-harm from January 2012-July 2022. Both change- point and auto regressive moving average (ARMA) models were fit to patient presentation numbers; expected change in presentation rates in pandemic months were compared to pre-pandemic time periods. Results There was an increasing pattern of suicidal ideation and self-harm presentations throughout the entire study period with an average baseline increase of 0.015 patient presentations per week. Change point and ARMA models both demonstrated an increase in patient presentations around April 2020; ARMA modeling estimated 1.67 additional patient presentations per week above pre-pandemic model predictions. Conclusion In the pandemic time period, there were significantly more patient presentations for suicidal ideation and intentional self-harm than would have been expected based on pre-pandemic patterns. This volume has continued up to two years after the pandemic declaration and has both mental health access and resource implications.

The current study explored how blame framing and self-reported prior knowledge of a 14 historical act of racial violence, labeled as Riot, Massacre, or Event, impacted individual’s 15 cumulative moral judgments regarding the groups involved in the Tulsa Race Massacre (Black 16 Tulsans, the Tulsa Police, and White Tulsans). 17Methods and results: This study was collected in two cohorts including undergraduates attending 18 the University of Oklahoma and individuals living in the United Kingdom. Participants were 19 randomly assigned to a blame framing condition, read a factual summary of what happened in 20 Tulsa in 1921, and then responded to various moral judgment items about each group. Individuals 21 without prior knowledge had higher average Likert ratings (more blame) towards Black Tulsans and 22 lower average Likert ratings (less blame) towards White Tulsans and the Tulsa Police compared to 23 participants with prior knowledge. This finding was largest when what participants read was framed 24 as a Massacre rather than a Riot or Event. We also found participants with prior knowledge 25 significantly differed in how they made moral judgments across target groups; those with prior 26 knowledge had lower average Likert ratings (less blame) for Black Tulsans and higher average Likert 27 ratings (more blame) for White Tulsans on items pertaining to causal responsibility, intentionality, 28 and punishment compared to participants without prior knowledge. 29Discussion: Findings suggest that the effect of blame framing on moral judgments is dependent on 30 prior knowledge. Implications for how people interpret both historical and new events involving 31 harmful consequences are discussed.},

  abstract = {Low socioeconomic status (L-SES) and the experience of traumatic stressful events (TSEs) are environmental factors implicated in behavioral deficits, abnormalities in brain development, and accelerated maturation. However, the relative contribution of these environmental factors is understudied.To compare the association of L-SES and TSEs with psychopathology, puberty, neurocognition, and multimodal neuroimaging parameters in brain maturation.The Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort is a community-based study examining psychopathology, neurocognition, and neuroimaging among participants recruited through the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia pediatric network. Participants are youths aged 8 to 21 years at enrollment with stable health and fluency in English. The sample of 9498 participants was racially (5298 European ancestry [55.8\%], 3124 African ancestry [32.9\%], and 1076 other [11.4\%]) and economically diverse. A randomly selected subsample (n\,=\,1601) underwent multimodal neuroimaging. Data were collected from November 5, 2009, through December 30, 2011, and analyzed from February 1 through November 7, 2018.The following domains were examined: (1) clinical, including psychopathology, assessed with a structured interview based on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, and puberty, assessed with the Tanner scale; (2) neurocognition, assessed by the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery; and (3) multimodal magnetic resonance imaging parameters of brain structure and function.A total of 9498 participants were included in the analysis (4906 [51.7\%] female; mean [SD] age, 14.2 [3.7] years). Clinically, L-SES and TSEs were associated with greater severity of psychiatric symptoms across the psychopathology domains of anxiety/depression, fear, externalizing behavior, and the psychosis spectrum. Low SES showed small effect sizes (highest for externalizing behavior, 0.306 SD; 95\% CI, 0.269 to 0.342), whereas TSEs had large effect sizes, with the highest in females for anxiety/depression (1.228 SD; 95\% CI, 1.156 to 1.300) and in males for the psychosis spectrum (1.099 SD; 95\% CI, 1.032 to 1.166). Both were associated with early puberty. Cognitively, L-SES had moderate effect sizes on poorer performance, the greatest being on complex cognition (−0.500 SD 95\% CI, −0.536 to −0.464), whereas TSEs were associated with slightly better memory (0.129 SD; 95\% CI, 0.084 to 0.174) and poorer complex reasoning (−0.109 SD; 95\% CI, −0.154 to −0.064). Environmental factors had common and distinct associations with brain structure and function. Structurally, both were associated with lower volume, but L-SES had correspondingly lower gray matter density, whereas TSEs were associated with higher gray matter density. Functionally, both were associated with lower regional cerebral blood flow and coherence and with accelerated brain maturation.Low SES and TSEs are associated with common and unique differences in symptoms, neurocognition, and structural and functional brain parameters. Both environmental factors are associated with earlier completion of puberty by physical features and brain parameters. These findings appear to underscore the need for identifying and preventing adverse environmental conditions associated with neurodevelopment.},

  abstract = {The parieto-frontal integration theory (PFIT) identified a fronto-parietal network of regions where individual differences in brain parameters most strongly relate to cognitive performance. PFIT was supported and extended in adult samples, but not in youths or within single-scanner well-powered multimodal studies. We performed multimodal neuroimaging in 1601 youths age 8–22 on the same 3-Tesla scanner with contemporaneous neurocognitive assessment, measuring volume, gray matter density (GMD), mean diffusivity (MD), cerebral blood flow (CBF), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) and regional homogeneity (ReHo), and activation to a working memory and a social cognition task. Across age and sex groups, better performance was associated with higher volumes, greater GMD, lower MD, lower CBF, higher ALFF and ReHo, and greater activation for the working memory task in PFIT regions. However, additional cortical, striatal, limbic, and cerebellar regions showed comparable effects, hence PFIT needs expansion into an extended PFIT (ExtPFIT) network incorporating nodes that support motivation and affect. Associations of brain parameters became stronger with advancing age group from childhood to adolescence to young adulthood, effects occurring earlier in females. This ExtPFIT network is developmentally fine-tuned, optimizing abundance and integrity of neural tissue while maintaining a low resting energy state.},

  abstract = {Irritability is an important dimension of psychopathology that spans multiple clinical diagnostic categories, yet its relationship to patterns of brain development remains sparsely explored. Here, we examined how transdiagnostic symptoms of irritability relate to the development of structural brain networks. All participants (n\,=\,137, 83 females) completed structural brain imaging with 3 Tesla MRI at two timepoints (mean age at follow-up: 21.1 years, mean inter-scan interval: 5.2 years). Irritability at follow-up was assessed using the Affective Reactivity Index, and cortical thickness was quantified using Advanced Normalization Tools software. Structural covariance networks were delineated using non-negative matrix factorization, a multivariate analysis technique. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with irritability at follow-up were evaluated using generalized additive models with penalized splines. The False Discovery Rate (q\,{$<$}\,0.05) was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Cross-sectional analysis of follow-up data revealed that 11 of the 24 covariance networks were associated with irritability, with higher levels of irritability being associated with thinner cortex. Longitudinal analyses further revealed that accelerated cortical thinning within nine networks was related to irritability at follow-up. Effects were particularly prominent in brain regions implicated in emotion regulation, including the orbitofrontal, lateral temporal, and medial temporal cortex. Collectively, these findings suggest that irritability is associated with widespread reductions in~cortical thickness and accelerated cortical thinning, particularly within the~frontal and temporal cortex. Aberrant structural maturation of regions important for emotional regulation may in part underlie symptoms of irritability.},

  abstract = {The high comorbidity among neuropsychiatric disorders suggests a possible common neurobiological phenotype. Resting-state regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) can be measured noninvasively with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and abnormalities in regional CBF are present in many neuropsychiatric disorders. Regional CBF may also provide a useful biological marker across different types of psychopathology. To investigate CBF changes common across psychiatric disorders, we capitalized upon a sample of 1042 youths (ages 11–23 years) who completed cross-sectional imaging as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. CBF at rest was quantified on a voxelwise basis using arterial spin labeled perfusion MRI at 3T. A dimensional measure of psychopathology was constructed using a bifactor model of item-level data from a psychiatric screening interview, which delineated four factors (fear, anxious-misery, psychosis and behavioral symptoms) plus a general factor: overall psychopathology. Overall psychopathology was associated with elevated perfusion in several regions including the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left rostral ACC. Furthermore, several clusters were associated with specific dimensions of psychopathology. Psychosis symptoms were related to reduced perfusion in the left frontal operculum and insula, whereas fear symptoms were associated with less perfusion in the right occipital/fusiform gyrus and left subgenual ACC. Follow-up functional connectivity analyses using resting-state functional MRI collected in the same participants revealed that overall psychopathology was associated with decreased connectivity between the dorsal ACC and bilateral caudate. Together, the results of this study demonstrate common and dissociable CBF abnormalities across neuropsychiatric disorders in youth.},

  abstract = {Background Internalizing disorders such as anxiety and depression are common psychiatric disorders that frequently begin in youth and exhibit marked heterogeneity in treatment response and clinical course. Given that symptom-based classification approaches do not align with underlying neurobiology, an alternative approach is to identify neurobiologically informed subtypes based on brain imaging data. Methods We used a recently developed semisupervised machine learning method (HYDRA [heterogeneity through discriminative analysis]) to delineate patterns of neurobiological heterogeneity within youths with internalizing symptoms using structural data collected at 3T from a sample of 1141 youths. Results Using volume and cortical thickness, cross-validation methods indicated 2 highly stable subtypes of internalizing youths (adjusted Rand index~= 0.66; permutation-based false discovery rate p {$<$} .001). Subtype 1, defined by smaller brain volumes and reduced cortical thickness, was marked by impaired cognitive performance and higher levels of psychopathology than both subtype 2 and typically developing youths. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion images not considered during clustering, we found that subtype 1 also showed reduced amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuations in frontolimbic regions at rest and reduced fractional anisotropy in several white matter tracts. In contrast, subtype 2 showed intact cognitive performance and greater volume, cortical thickness, and amplitudes during rest compared with subtype 1 and typically developing youths, despite still showing clinically significant levels of psychopathology. Conclusions We identified 2 subtypes of internalizing youths differentiated by abnormalities in brain structure, function, and white matter integrity, with one of the subtypes showing poorer functioning across multiple domains. Identification of biologically grounded internalizing subtypes may assist in targeting early interventions and assessing longitudinal prognosis.},

The present study investigates parent attributions in the context of Parent–Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) in child-welfare involved families. PCIT has two treatment phases, the first of which focuses on fostering a warm parent–child relationship and the second of which provides parents a positive discipline framework. This study characterizes individual differences in stability and change in parent attributions over the course of the intervention. It explores the impact of family treatment dosage on parent attributions as well as the impact of parent attributions on positive parenting skills outcomes. In a sample of 149 families involved with the child-welfare system (children aged 3–7, 59\% nonwhite, 11\% Hispanic, 50\% female), multinomial logistic regression analyses and ANCOVAs were used. Results showed that engaging in additional treatment sessions increased the odds of parent attributions about their child increasing in warmth. Additionally, parents whose positive attributions of their child increased over time used more positive parenting behaviors in a cleanup task at posttreatment. These findings demonstrate that parent attributions about their child play an important role in behavioral parent training interventions. Future research should investigate how to leverage parent attributions to improve family treatment outcomes.},

  abstract = {A substantial body of work supports the existence of a general psychopathology factor (“p”). Psychometrically, this is important because it implies that there is a psychological phenomenon (overall psychopathology) that can be measured and potentially used in clinical research or treatment. The present study aimed to construct, calibrate, and begin to validate a computerized adaptive (CAT) screener for “p”. In a large community sample (N\,=\,4544; age 11–21), we modeled 114 clinical items using a bifactor multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) model and constructed a fully functional (and public) CAT for assessing “p” called the Overall mental illness (OMI) screener. In a random, non-overlapping sample (N\,=\,1019) with extended phenotyping (neuroimaging) from the same community cohort, adaptive versions of the OMI screener (10-, 20-, and 40-item) were simulated and compared to the full 114-item test in their ability to predict demographic characteristics, common mental disorders, and brain parameters. The OMI screener performed almost as well as the full test, despite being only a small fraction of the length. For prediction of 13 mental disorders, the mid-length (20-item) adaptive version showed mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76, compared to 0.79 for the full version. For prediction of brain parameters, mean absolute standardized relationship was 0.06 for the 20-item adaptive version, compared to 0.07 for the full form. This brief, public tool may facilitate the rapid and accurate measurement of overall psychopathology in large-scale studies and in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Background Assessment of risks of illnesses has been an important part of medicine for decades. We now have hundreds of ‘risk calculators’ for illnesses, including brain disorders, and these calculators are continually improving as more diverse measures are collected on larger samples. Methods We first replicated an existing psychosis risk calculator and then used our own sample to develop a similar calculator for use in recruiting ‘psychosis risk’ enriched community samples. We assessed 632 participants age 8–21 (52\% female; 48\% Black) from a community sample with longitudinal data on neurocognitive, clinical, medical, and environmental variables. We used this information to predict psychosis spectrum (PS) status in the future. We selected variables based on lasso, random forest, and statistical inference relief; and predicted future PS using ridge regression, random forest, and support vector machines. Results Cross-validated prediction diagnostics were obtained by building and testing models in randomly selected sub-samples of the data, resulting in a distribution of the diagnostics; we report the mean. The strongest predictors of later PS status were the Children's Global Assessment Scale; delusions of predicting the future or having one's thoughts/actions controlled; and the percent married in one's neighborhood. Random forest followed by ridge regression was most accurate, with a cross-validated area under the curve (AUC) of 0.67. Adjustment of the model including only six variables reached an AUC of 0.70. Conclusions Results support the potential application of risk calculators for screening and identification of at-risk community youth in prospective investigations of developmental trajectories of the PS.},

  abstract = {Prematurity is associated with diverse developmental abnormalities, yet few studies relate cognitive and neurostructural deficits to a dimensional measure of prematurity. Leveraging a large sample of children, adolescents, and young adults (age 8–22 years) studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we examined how variation in gestational age impacted cognition and brain structure later in development. Participants included 72 preterm youth born before 37 weeks’ gestation and 206 youth who were born at term (37 weeks or later). Using a previously-validated factor analysis, cognitive performance was assessed in three domains: (1) executive function and complex reasoning, (2) social cognition, and (3) episodic memory. All participants completed T1-weighted neuroimaging at 3 T to measure brain volume. Structural covariance networks were delineated using non-negative matrix factorization, an advanced multivariate analysis technique. Lower gestational age was associated with both deficits in executive function and reduced volume within 11 of 26 structural covariance networks, which included orbitofrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices as well as subcortical regions including the hippocampus. Notably, the relationship between lower gestational age and executive dysfunction was accounted for in part by structural network deficits. Together, these findings emphasize the durable impact of prematurity on cognition and brain structure, which persists across development.},

Recently, the use of multi-shell diffusion imaging sequences has coincided with advances in modeling the diffusion signal, such as Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) and Laplacian-regularized Mean Apparent Propagator MRI (MAPL). However, the relative utility of recently-developed diffusion models for understanding brain maturation remains sparsely investigated. Additionally, despite evidence that motion artifact is a major confound for studies of development, the vulnerability of metrics derived from contemporary models to in-scanner motion has not been described. Accordingly, in a sample of 120 youth and young adults (ages 12–30) we evaluated metrics derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), NODDI, and MAPL for associations with age and in-scanner head motion at multiple scales. Specifically, we examined mean white matter values, white matter tracts, white matter voxels, and connections in structural brain networks. Our results revealed that multi-shell diffusion imaging data can be leveraged to robustly characterize neurodevelopment, and demonstrate stronger age effects than equivalent single-shell data. Additionally, MAPL-derived metrics were less sensitive to the confounding effects of head motion. Our findings suggest that multi-shell imaging data and contemporary modeling techniques confer important advantages for studies of neurodevelopment.},

Thus, longitudinal diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was used to investigate WM abnormalities in youth at-risk for psychosis. A subset of individuals from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) completed two DWI scans approximately 20 months apart. Youths were identified through structured interview as having subthreshold persistent psychosis risk symptoms (n\,=\,46), and were compared to healthy typically developing participants (TD; n\,=\,98). Analyses were conducted at voxelwise and regional levels. Nonlinear developmental patterns were examined using penalized splines within a generalized additive model. Compared to TD, youth with persistent psychosis risk symptoms had lower whole-brain WM fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher radial diffusivity (RD). Voxelwise analyses revealed clusters of significant WM abnormalities within the temporal and parietal lobes. Lower FA within the cingulum bundle of hippocampus and cerebrospinal tracts were the most robust deficits in individuals with persistent psychosis symptoms. These findings were consistent over two visits. Thus, it appears that WM abnormalities are present early in youth with persistent psychosis risk symptoms, however, there is little evidence to suggest that these features emerge in late adolescence or early adulthood. Future studies should seek to characterize WM abnormalities in younger individuals and follow individuals as subthreshold psychotic symptoms emerge.},

  abstract = {Structured assessment of clinical phenotypes is a burdensome procedure, largely due to the time required. One method to alleviate this is “skip-logic,” which allows for portions of an interview to be skipped if initial (“screen”) items are not endorsed. The bias that skip-logic introduces to resultant continuous scores is unknown and can be explored using Item Response Theory. Interview response data were simulated while varying 5 characteristics of the measures: number of screen items, difficulty (clinical severity) of the screens, difficulty of non-screen items, shape of the trait distribution, and range of discrimination parameters. The number of simulations and examinees were held constant at 2,000 and 10,000, respectively. A criterion variable correlating 0.80 with the measured trait was also simulated, and the outcome of interest was the difference between the correlations of the criterion variable and the two estimated scores (with and without skip-logic). Effects of the simulation conditions on this outcome were explored using ANOVA. All main effects and interactions were significant. The largest 2-way interaction was between number of screen items and average item discrimination, such that the number of screen items had a large effect on bias only when discrimination parameters were low. This, among other interactions explored here, suggests that skip-logic can bias results using continuous scores; however, the effects of this bias are usually inconsequential. Skip-logic in clinical assessments can introduce bias in continuous sum scores, but this bias can usually be ignored.},

  abstract = {Cognitive neuroscience has inspired a number of methodological advances to extract the highest signal-to-noise ratio from neuroimaging data. Popular techniques used to summarize behavioral data include sum-scores and item response theory (IRT). While these techniques can be useful when applied appropriately, item dimensionality and the quality of information are often unexplored allowing poor performing items to be included in analyses. The purpose of this study is to highlight how the application of two-stage approaches introduces parameter bias, differential item functioning (DIF) can manifest in cognitive neuroscience data and how techniques such as the multiple indicator multiple cause (MIMIC) model can identify and remove these issues. This was performed using a simulation and an empirical study. The simulation explores parameter bias across two separate techniques used to summarize behavioral data: sum-scores and IRT and formative relationships with those estimated from a MIMIC model. In an empirical study participants performed an emotional identification task while concurrent electroencephalogram data were acquired across 384 trials. Participants were asked to identify the emotion presented by a static face of a child across four categories: happy, neutral, discomfort, and distress. The primary outcomes of interest were P200 event-related potential (ERP) amplitude and latency within each emotion category. Instances of DIF related to correct emotion identification were explored with respect to an individual’s neurophysiology using a multiple cause multiple indicator (MIMIC) model. The MIMIC model’s sensitivity was then compared to popular two-stage approaches for cognitive performance summary scores, including sum-scores and an IRT model framework and then regressing these onto the ERP characteristics. Here sensitivity refers to the magnitude and significance of coefficients relating the brain to these behavioral outcomes. The first set of analyses displayed instances of DIF within all four emotions which were then removed from all further models. The next set of analyses compared the two-stage approaches with the MIMIC model. Only the MIMIC model identified any significant brain-behavior relationships. Taken together, these results indicate that item performance can be gleaned from subject-specific biomarkers, and that techniques such as the MIMIC model may be useful tools to derive complex item-level brain-behavior relationships.},

  abstract = {Data quality is increasingly recognized as one of the most important confounding factors in brain imaging research. It is particularly important for studies of brain development, where age is systematically related to in-scanner motion and data quality. Prior work has demonstrated that in-scanner head motion biases estimates of structural neuroimaging measures. However, objective measures of data quality are not available for most structural brain images. Here we sought to identify quantitative measures of data quality for T1-weighted volumes, describe how such measures of quality relate to cortical thickness, and delineate how this in turn may bias inference regarding associations with age in youth. Three highly-trained raters provided manual ratings of 1,840 raw T1-weighted volumes. These images included a training set of 1,065 images from Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), a test set of 533 images from the PNC, as well as an external test set of 242 adults acquired on a different scanner. Manual ratings were compared to automated quality measures provided by the Preprocessed Connectomes Project's Quality Assurance Protocol (QAP), as well as FreeSurfer's Euler number, which summarizes the topological complexity of the reconstructed cortical surface. Results revealed that the Euler number was consistently correlated with manual ratings across samples. Furthermore, the Euler number could be used to identify images scored “unusable” by human raters with a high degree of accuracy (AUC: 0.98-0.99), and out-performed proxy measures from functional timeseries acquired in the same scanning session. The Euler number also was significantly related to cortical thickness in a regionally heterogeneous pattern that was consistent across datasets and replicated prior results. Finally, data quality both inflated and obscured associations with age during adolescence. Taken together, these results indicate that reliable measures of data quality can be automatically derived from T1-weighted volumes, and that failing to control for data quality can systematically bias the results of studies of brain maturation.},
